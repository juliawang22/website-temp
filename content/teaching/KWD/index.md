Kids with Dreams is Stanford's only organization dedicated to working with individuals with disabilites. We service over 400 families in the Bay Area and provide 100+ hours of programming a quarter through 10+ programs. We partner Stanford volunteers with local community organizations as well as organize many of our own programs and events.
